I'm currently a research associate at the [Department of Economics](http://economia.uc.cl) at PUC Chile and a lecturer at the [Department of Engineering and Sciences](https://ingenieria.uai.cl/) at UAI. Also, I'm applying for Economics PhD programs (Fall 2021).

My research interests lie in the fields of macroeconomics and information economics.

You can find my CV [here](https://vjimenezg.github.io/files/CV_VJG.pdf).
