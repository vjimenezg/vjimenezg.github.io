I'm currently working as a research assistant at the economics department of PUC Chile and as a lecturer at the Engineering and Sciences department at UAI. I'm applying for Economics PhD programs (Fall 2021).

My research interests lie in the fields of macroeconomics and information economics.

You can find my CV [here](https://vjimenezg.github.io/files/CV_VJG.pdf).
