I'm currently working as a research associate at the Department of Economics at PUC Chile and as a lecturer at the Department of Engineering and Sciences at UAI. Also, I'm applying for Economics PhD programs (Fall 2021).

My research interests lie in the fields of macroeconomics and information economics.

You can find my CV [here](https://vjimenezg.github.io/files/CV_VJG.pdf).
